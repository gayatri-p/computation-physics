# Applications of Numerical Calculus in Multidisciplinary Problems

Numerical Calculus and Differential Equations have wide range of applications in various different fields. Here, we have presented five such practical applications by solving problem statements as described in *Numerical Methods: An Inquiry Based Approach with Python* by Eric Sullivan.

The first two problems involve solving ordinary and partial differential equations, in particular, the heat equation, to find the ideal wall thickness of an adobe house and visualise population growth and diffusion.
The last three problems use concepts of numerical differentiation and integration to perform edge detection in images, calculate total water discharge through a dam and measure emission lines strengths of a galaxy spectrum.

This website contains all code used throughout the project as well as simulational plots and animations.
